# Tetris

Simple Tetris game library.

This library was originally made for an Arduino based GameBox hardware. However, the solution was platform independent, therefore, it can be applied in other solutions, as well.
There can be found demo applications in the repository so as to show how can it be used in different environments.

TODO:
* Arduino demo
* C# version with WPF demo
